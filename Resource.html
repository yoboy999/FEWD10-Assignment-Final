                <h3>Optimising Salesforce business processes</h3>
                <h4>The Cobbler’s children have no shoes by AAKonsult</h4> 
                <a href="http://aakonsult.com/optimising-salesforce-business-processes/" alt=AAKonsult></a>
                <p>It’s often said that a The Cobbler’s children have no shoes, or noted that a builders own house is never completed.</p>

            <p>We at AAkonsult have always been ones to drink our own campaign and by this I mean use ourselves as good examples of how organisations should be using Salesforce.  Right from day one, all employees used salesforce for their contacts, managing activities, opportunity pipeline and more.  We ran our proposal and invoicing from MS Mail merged documents and then sent them with nicely formatted email templates that had links to Salesforce content delivery.</p>

            <p>But with all good things in life, there is often a better way of managing things.  When we started out and doing a smaller number of proposals, it was quite manageable to do the mail merge and have it emailed to you, then to save that to a shared folder, upload it back into Salesforce through Content Delivery, copy the link back onto the opportunity, select the email template and send.</p>

            <p>Not only was this process quite a bit for us to do, but our customers would then receive the document, print it out, scan it and email it back to us.  This would often take them a while to do and often they gave it a lower priority as it was difficult.</p>

            <p>As with all business planning cycles, we picked up that we had been providing much more efficient processes to many of our customers than what we were doing internally.  This was achieved through automation and simplicity of using Conga.</p>

            <p>We set about setting up all of our templates using Conga for merging of proposals and Sertifi for electronic document signing.  Now, with a one click button, we are able to generate a document, store that in salesforce and send it to our customers.</p>

            <p>Often, we get a fully signed document through Sertifi returned within minutes. We no longer feel like the Cobblers children, but the masters of efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Duplicate Data</h3>
                <h4>Article by AAKonsult</h4> 
                <p>Duplicate data can occur when data merges in Excel go wrong or data is collected from multiple places or even just human error.</p>
                <p>Impact</p>
                <p>Duplicate data will result in inaccurate reports.  Duplicate data will be counted twice. Key information may be spread over the duplicated records. This means that no one record holds all the contact’s information. If you use the email functionality, the duplicate contacts will get duplicate emails.</p>
                <p>Remedy</p>
                <p>Duplicate records can’t just be deleted on mass as they contain vital information that doesn’t appear on the designated original record.</p>
                <p>Commercial software tools are available to de-duplicate (often just called ‘dedup’) records. The duplicated records could also be extracted to a spreadsheet and merged manually or merged within the database itself</p>
